          I'm Cesar, a passionate full-stack developer* based in Per√∫, who loves
          to code everything he can. Always learning, my goal is to expand my
          knowlegde and grow as a developer. I always wanted to know how web
          pages work, from how they loaded the images, their design to their
          payment methods. and I got into the world of programming without fear,
          I really like the design, the animations and the power to translate
          ideas into a web in the best and most beautiful way.
